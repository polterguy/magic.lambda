# Magic Lambda for .Net

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/polterguy/magic.lambda.svg?master)](https://travis-ci.org/polterguy/magic.lambda)

Magic Lambda is a microscopic Turing complete programming language based upon [Magic Node](https://github.com/polterguy/magic.node)
and [Magic Signals](https://github.com/polterguy/magic.signals). It provides the familiar _"keywords"_, such as **[for-each]**
and **[if]**, by exposing [Super Signal Slots](https://dzone.com/articles/super-signals-in-aspnet-core) for these keywords,
making them easily available for you in your Hyperlambda code. Althought technically not entirely true, this project is what allows Hyperlambda to become _"Turing complete"_, and gives you what most would consider to be a fully fledged _"programming language"_.

## Structure

Since _everything_ is a slot in Hyperlambda, this allows you to evaluate its conditional operators and logical operators,
the same way you would evaluate a function in a traditional programming language. This might at first seem a bit unintuitive
if you come from a traditional programming language, but has a lot of advantages, such as allowing the computer to look
at the entirety of your function objects as hierarchical tree structures, parsing them as such, and imagining these as
_"execution trees"_.

For instance, in a normal programming language, the equal operator must have a left hand side (lhs), and a right hand
side (rhs). In Hyperlambda this is not true, since the equal slot is the main invocation of a function, requiring two
arguments, allowing you to think about it as a _function_. To compare this to the way a traditional programming might
have implemented this, imagine the equal operator as a function, such as the following pseudo code illustrates.

```
=(arg1, arg1)
```

The actual Hyperlambda code that would be the equivalent of the above pseudo code, can be found below.

```
eq
   .:arg1
   .:arg2
```

As you study Hyperlambda, it might be beneficial to use the _"Evaluator"_ component that you can find in its
frontend Angular dashboard website. This component allows you to play with Hyperlambda in _"immediate mode"_,
allowing you to experiment with it, execute it immediately from your browser, using a very rich code editor,
providing syntax highlighting, autocomplete on slots, and allows you to save your snippets for later on your
server. If you do this, then click the _"information button"_ in the component to learn the basic shortcuts,
and access help in general. Below is a screenshot of the _"Evaluator"_ component to give you an idea of what
you might expect.

<img alt="Hyperlambda Evaluator" title="Hyperlambda Evaluator" src="https://servergardens.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/evaluator.png" />

Logically the Hyperlambda evaluator will signal each nodes in your Hyperlambda code, sequentially, assuming
all of your nodes are referencing a `ISlot` class, unless the node's name starts with a _"."_.

## Hyperlambda structure

Hyperlambda is the textual representation of a node structure, where each node has a name, an optional value,
and a collection of children nodes. Imagine the following Hyperlambda.

```
name:value
   child1
```

In the above Hyperlambda, there is one root node. Its name is _"name"_, its value is _"value"_, and this node
has one child node, with the name of _"child1"_. Its child node does _not_ however have a value, which results
in its value being _"null"_. The reason why the Hyperlambda parser understands _"child1"_ as the child of 
the _"name"_ node, is because it is prefixed by 3 spaces (SP) relatively to the _"name"_ node. This allows you
to create graph objects (tree structures) with any depth you wish, by simply starting out with the number of
spaces the node above has, add 3 additional spaces, and you can declare children nodes of the above node.

If you think of these nodes as a sequence of function invocations, from the top to bottom, where all of the
nodes are assumed to be referencing slots - You can imagine how the tree structure resulting from parsing
Hyperlambda into a graph object can easily be evaluated, due to its recursive nature, making it easy to
express idioms such as _"if"_, _"while"_, _"for-each"_, etc.

Since each slot will be invoked with the node referencing the slot itself as the _"input"_ `Node`,
this makes the Hyperlambda evaluator recursive in nature, allowing a slot to evaluate all of its children,
after executing its custom logic, etc.

All nodes starting with a _"."_ will be ignored, and not attempted to raised from the Hyperlambda evaluator.
This has two benefits.

1. You can create _"hidden"_ slots, that are only accessible from C#.
2. You can use nodes starting with _"."_ as data nodes, separating function invocations from data.

This trait of Hyperlambda makes it _"super functional"_ in nature. Below is an example of a Hyperlambda
piece of code, that illustrates this, by adding a _"callback"_ lambda object to its POP3 fetch emails
slot, which will be invoked once for each available email on your POP3 server.

```
/*
 * Example of how to retrieve emails form a POP3 server.
 */
mail.pop3.fetch
   server
      host:pop.gmail.com
      port:int:995
      secure:bool:true
      username:gmail-username@gmail.com
      password:Gmail-Password
   max:int:50
   raw:bool:false
   .lambda

      /*
       * Some lambda object invoked once for every email fetched.
       * Given message as [.message] node structured as lambda.
       */
      lambda2hyper:x:..
      log.info:x:-
```

The `ISlot` called **[mail.pop3.fetch]** will invoke the above **[.lambda]** object once for each email
it finds on the POP3 server it connects to.

If this sounds complex to you, don't worry and just play around with existing snippets in your _"Evaluator"_
component, which should have tons of documentation and example snippets for you, that you can play around
with, to easily understand Hyperlambda by trying it out for yourself.

### Tokens

The separating of a node's name and its value, is done by using a ":" character. To the left is the node's
name, and to the right is its value. The value of a node can also be a C# type of string, using double
quotes, and even single quotes or prefix your opening double quote with an "@" character, allowing you
to use carriage returns in your strings the same way you would do in for instance C#. Below is an example

```
.str1:"   This is a \r\n  string"
.str2:' This is also a string '
.str3:@"This
    is
  also a
      string"
```

Strings in Hyperlambda can be escaped with the exact same semantics as you would escape your C# strings.

## Lambda expressions

To understand Hyperlambda, and how to efficiently create your own Hyperlambda, you'll have to understand
_"lambda expressions"_. These are kind of like XPath expressions. However, instead of referencing XML
nodes, lambda expressions are referencing lambda nodes. This allows you to retrieve node names, values,
and their children collection - For either to manipulate these, or read their values and react accordingly.

Notice, Hyperlambda does not separate between a _"variable"_ and a _"function invocation"_ - Hence, a node
might serve as both at the same time. This allows you to dynamically modify your lambda structure, as you
traverse it, and executes it - But this creates another problem for you, which is that you will need
a mechanism to store data. This is accomplished by prefixing a node's name with a "." character, at which point
the Hyperlambda evaluator will ignore it, as it is traversing your tree, and _not_ attempt to signal
that particular node as a slot.

Combining _"data nodes"_ with expressions, allows you to use, modify and reference these as _"variables"_.
Below is an example.

```
.src:foo
.dest
set-value:x:@.dest
   get-value:x:@.src
```

What the above code basically translates into, is.

> Set the value of the [.dest] node to the value of [.src]

## Reference documentation

Magic Lambda contains the following slots.

### [if]

This is the Hyperlambda equivalent of `if` from other programming languages. It allows you to test for some condition,
and evaluate a lambda object, only if the condition evaluates to true. **[if]** must be given exactly two arguments.
The first argument can be anything, including a slot invocation - But its second argument must be its **[.lambda]**
argument. The **[.lambda]** node will be evaluated as a lambda object, only if the first argument to **[if]** evaluates
to boolean true. Below is an example.

```
.dest
if
   .:bool:true
   .lambda
      set-value:x:@.dest
         .:yup!
```

### [else-if]

**[else-if]** is the younger brother of **[if]**, and must be preceeded by its older brother, or other **[else-if]** nodes,
and will only be evaluated if all of its previous conditional slots evaluates to false - At which point **[else-if]** is
allowed to test its condition - And only if it evaluates to true, evaluate its lambda object. Semantically **[else-if]**
is similar to **[if]**, in that it requires exactly two arguments with the same structure as **[if]**.

```
.dest
if
   .:bool:false
   .lambda
      set-value:x:@.dest
         .:yup!
else-if
   .:bool:true
   .lambda
      set-value:x:@.dest
         .:yup2.0!
```

### [else]

**[else]** is the last of the _"conditional siblings"_ that will only be evaluated as a last resort, only if none of its
elder _"siblings"_ evaluates to true. Notice, contrary to both **[if]** and **[else-if]**, **[else]** contains its lambda object
directly as children nodes, and _not_ within a **[.lambda]** node. This is because **[else]** does not require any
conditional arguments like **[if]** and **[else-if]** does. An example can be found below.

```
.src:int:3
.dest
if
   eq
      get-value:x:@.src
      .:int:1
   .lambda
      set-value:x:@.dest
         .:yup!
else-if
   eq
      get-value:x:@.src
      .:int:2
   .lambda
      set-value:x:@.dest
         .:yup2.0!
else
   set-value:x:@.dest
      .:nope
```

### [eq]

**[eq]** is the equality _"operator"_ in Magic, and it requires two arguments, both of which will be evaluated as potential
signals - And the result of evaluating **[eq]** will only be true if the values of these two arguments are _exactly the same_.
Notice, the comparison operator will consider types, which implies that boolean true will _not_ be considered equal to the string
value of _"true"_, etc.

```
.src:int:5
eq
   get-value:x:@.src
   .:int:5
```

### [lt]

**[lt]** will do a comparison between its two arguments, and only return true if its first argument is _"less than"_
its seconds argument. Consider the following.

```
.src1:int:4
lt
   get-value:x:@.src1
   .:int:5
```

### [lte]

**[lte]** will do a comparison between its two arguments, and only return true if its first argument is _"less than or equal"_
to its seconds argument. Consider the following.

```
.src1:int:4
lte
   get-value:x:@.src1
   .:int:4
```

### [mt]

**[mt]** will do a comparison between its two arguments, and only return true if its first argument is _"more than"_
its seconds argument. Consider the following.

```
.src1:int:7
mt
   get-value:x:@.src1
   .:int:5
```

### [mte]

**[mte]** will do a comparison between its two arguments, and only return true if its first argument is _"more than or equal"_
to its seconds argument. Consider the following.

```
.src1:int:7
mte
   get-value:x:@.src1
   .:int:5
```

### [exists]

**[exists]** will evaluate to true if its specified expression yields one or more results. If not, it will
return false.

```
.src1
   foo
.src2
exists:x:@.src1/*
exists:x:@.src2/*
```

### [and]

**[and]** requires two or more arguments, and will only evaluate to true, if all of its arguments evaluates to true. Consider
the following.

```
and
   .:bool:true
   .:bool:false
and
   .:bool:true
   .:bool:true
```

And will (of course) evaluate its arguments before checking if they evaluate to true, allowing you to use it as a part
of richer comparison trees, such as the following illustrates.

```
.s1:bool:true
.s2:bool:true
.res
if
   and
      get-value:x:@.s1
      get-value:x:@.s2
   .lambda
      set-value:x:@.res
         .:OK
```

### [or]

**[or]** is similar to **[and]**, except it will evaluate to true if _any_ of its arguments evaluates to true, such
as the following illustrates. **[or]** will also evaluate its arguments, allowing you to use it as a part of richer comparison
trees, the same way **[and]** allows you to. Below is a simple example.

```
or
   .:bool:false
   .:bool:false
or
   .:bool:false
   .:bool:true
```

### [not]

**[not]** expects _exactly one argument_, and will negate its boolean value, whatever it is, such as the following illustrates.

```
not
   .:bool:true
not
   .:bool:false
```

**[not]** will also evaluate its argument, allowing you to use it in richer comparison trees, the same you could do
with both **[or]** and **[and]**.

### [switch]

**[switch]** works similarly as a switch/case block in a traditional programming language, and will find the
first **[case]** node with a value matching the evaluated value of the **[switch]** node, and execute that
**[case]** node as a lambda object.

```
.val:foo
.result
switch:x:@.val
   case:bar
      set-value:x:@.result
         .:Oops
   case:foo
      set-value:x:@.result
         .:Success!
```

The **[switch]** slot can only contain two children nodes, **[case]** and **[default]**. The **[default]** node
will be evaluated if _none_ of the **[case]** node's values are matching the evaluated value of your **[switch]**.
Try evaluating the following in your _"Evaluator"_ to understand what I mean.

```
.val:fooXX
.result
switch:x:@.val
   case:bar
      set-value:x:@.result
         .:Oops
   case:foo
      set-value:x:@.result
         .:Oops2.0
   default
      set-value:x:@.result
         .:Success!
```

In the above, the expression evaluated in the switch, which is `@.val` will become _"fooXX"_ after evaluating it.
None of its children **[case]** nodes contains this as an option, hence the **[default]** node will be evaluated,
and this results in setting the **[.result]** node's value to _"Success!"_.

**[default]** _cannot_ have a value, and all your **[case]** nodes must have a _constant_ value, meaning not
an expression. However, any types can be used as values for your **[case]** nodes. And your **[switch]** node
must at the very least have minimum one **[case]** node. The **[default]** node is optional though.

### [add]

This slot allws you to dynamically add nodes into a destination node. Its primary argument is the destination,
and it assumes that each children is a collection of nodes it should append to the destination node's children
collection. The reasons for this additional level of indirection, is because the **[add]** slot might have
children that are by themselves slot invocations, which it will evaluate before it starts adding the children
nodes of these arguments to its destination node's children collection. Below is an example.

```
.dest
add:x:@.dest
   .
      foo1:howdy
      foo2:world
   .
      bar1:hello
      bar2:world
```

Notice how all the 4 nodes above (foo1, foo2, bar1, bar2) are appended into the **[.dest]** node's children
collection. This allows you to evaluate slots and add the result of your slot invocation into the destination,
such as the following illustrates.

```
.src
   foo1:foo
   foo2:bar
.dest
add:x:@.dest
   get-nodes:x:@.src/*
```

**[add]** can also take an expression leading to multiple destinations as its main argument, allowing you to
add a copy of your source nodes into multiple node collections at the same time, with one invocation.

### [insert-before]

This slot functions exactly the same as the **[add]** node, except it will insert the nodes _before_ the
node(s) referenced in its main argument.

```
.foo
   foo1
   foo2
insert-before:x:@.foo/*/foo1
   .
      inserted
```

### [insert-after]

This slot functions exactly the same as the **[add]** node, except it will insert the nodes _after_ the
node(s) referenced in its main argument.

```
.foo
   foo1
   foo2
insert-after:x:@.foo/*/foo1
   .
      inserted
```

### [remove-nodes]

This slot will remove all nodes its expression is pointing to.

```
.data
   foo1
   foo2
   foo3
remove-nodes:x:@.data/*/foo2
```

### [set-name]

Changes the name of a node referenced as its main expression to whatever its single source happens to be.

```
.foo
   old-name
set-name:x:@.foo/*
   .:new-name
```

### [set-value]

Changes the value of a node referenced as its main expression to whatever its single source happens to be.

```
.foo
set-value:x:@.foo
   .:SUCCESS
```

### [unwrap]

This slot is useful if you want to invoke another slot, but before you do, you want to evaluate some expressions
inside of some argument to your slot. Imagine the following.

```
.src:Hello World
unwrap:x:+
.dest:x:@.src
```

In the above example, before the **[.dest]** node is reached by the Hyperlambda instruction pointer, the value
of the **[.dest]** node will have been _"unwrapped"_ (evaluated), and its value will be _"Hello World"_.

### [get-count]

This slot returns the number of nodes its expression is pointing to.

```
.data
   foo1
   foo2
get-count:x:@.data/*
```

### [get-name]

Returns the name of the node referenced in its expression.

```
.foo
get-name:x:-
```

### [get-nodes]

Returns the nodes its expression is referencing.

```
.data
   foo1
   foo2
get-nodes:x:-/*
```

### [get-value]

Returns the value of the node its expression is pointing to.

```
.data:Hello World
get-value:x:-
```

### [reference]

This slot will evaluate its expression, and add the entire node the expression is pointing to, as a referenced node into
its value. This allows you to pass a node _into_ a slot, and have that slot modify the node itself by reference,
which might sometimes be useful to have slots modify some original graph object, or parts of a graph.

```
.foo
reference:x:@.foo
set-value:x:-/#
   .:Yup!
```

You can think of this slot as the singular version og **[get-nodes]**, except instead of returning multiple
nodes, it assumes its expression only points to a single node, and instead of returning a copy of the node,
it returns the actual node by reference.

### [convert]

This slot converts the value of an expression from its original type, to whatever **[type]** declaration you
supply as its argument.

```
.foo:57
convert:x:-
   type:int
```

### [try]

This slot allows you to create a try/catch/finally block of lambda, from where exceptions are caught,
and optionally hadled in a **[.catch]** lambda, and/or a **[.finally]** lambda.

```
try
   throw:Whatever
.catch
   log.info:ERROR HAPPENED!! 42, 42, 42!
.finally
   log.info:Yup, we are finally there!
```

### [throw]

This slot simply throws an exception. See the **[try]** slot for an example.

### [for-each]

Iterates through each node as a result of an expression, and evaluates its lambda object,
passing in the currently iterated node as a **[.dp]** argument, containing the actual node
iterated by reference.

```
.data
   foo1
   foo2
for-each:x:-/*
   set-value:x:@.dp/#
      .:hello
```

### [while]

Semantically similar to **[if]**, but instead of evaluating its lambda object once, will iterate it for
as long as the condition evaluates to true.

```
.no:int:0
.res
while
   lt
      get-value:x:@.no
      .:int:5
   .lambda
      add:x:@.res
         .
            foo
      math.increment:x:@.no
```

### [eval]

Evaluates each lambda object found by either inspecting its children collection, or evaluating the
expression found in its value.

```
.res
.lambda
   set-value:x:@.res
      .:OK
eval:x:@.lambda
```

### [vocabulary]

Returns the name of every static slot in your system, optional passing in a string,or an expression leading to
a string, which is a filtering condition where the slot must _start_ with the filter in its name, to be considered
a part of the end result.

```
// Returns ALL slots in your system.
vocabulary

// Returns only slots starting with [io.file]
vocabulary:io.file
```
